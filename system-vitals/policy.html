**Privacy Policy for System Vitals**

This Privacy Policy describes how System Vitals ("we," "us," or "our") handles information when you use our mobile application (the "App"). Our commitment is to your privacy, and we have designed our App with this principle in mind.

**Information We Do Not Collect**

System Vitals is a diagnostic tool designed to test the hardware and software functions of your device. We do **not** collect, store, transmit, or share any personally identifiable information (PII) such as your name, email address, contacts, or photos. All tests are performed locally on your device, and the results are for your eyes only.

**Permissions and Hardware Access**

To perform its diagnostic functions, the App requests permission to access certain hardware components. Here is a list of sensitive permissions and why we need them:

*   **Camera (android.permission.CAMERA):** This permission is used **only** for the "Front Camera Test" and "Back Camera Test" features to display the camera feed on your screen. We do not record, store, or transmit any images or videos.
*   **Microphone (android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO):** This permission is used **only** for the "Microphone Test" feature to measure audio input levels. We do not record, store, or transmit any audio.
*   **Location (android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION):** This permission is required by the Android operating system to scan for nearby Wi-Fi and Bluetooth networks. We use it **only** for the "Wi-Fi Test" and "Bluetooth Test" features. We do not track, store, or transmit your location data.
*   **Bluetooth (android.permission.BLUETOOTH_SCAN, android.permission.BLUETOOTH_CONNECT):** These permissions are used **only** for the "Bluetooth Test" feature to find and list nearby Bluetooth devices.

**Third-Party Services**

The App uses Google AdMob to display advertisements. AdMob is a third-party service and may collect information used to identify you. We encourage you to review the privacy policy of Google for more information on how they handle data:

**Changes to This Privacy Policy**

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
